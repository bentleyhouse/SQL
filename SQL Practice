In this file are examples of SQL questions I have answered. 

--Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically. 
(SELECT city, length(city) as length FROM station 
WHERE 1 ORDER BY length ASC, city ASC
LIMIT 1)
UNION
(SELECT city, length(city) as length FROM station
WHERE 1 ORDER BY length DESC, city DESC
LIMIT 1);

--Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT distinct city FROM station 
WHERE city REGEXP "^[aeiou].*";
