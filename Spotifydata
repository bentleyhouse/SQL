For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
I then inserted the Spotify data into a new table and performed analytics on it using SQL.

—First, I determined the average popularity, duration, and tempo by artist and track. 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(popularity), AVG(duration_ms), AVG(tempo)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;


—Next, I determined the top 20 songs based on the “energy” rating.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(popularity), AVG(duration_ms), AVG(tempo)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;


—Next, I determined the top 10 most popular songs. 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY popularity 
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;


—Lastly, I determined the 10 least popular songs in the data set.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY popularity
ORDER BY popularity ASC
LIMIT 10;
